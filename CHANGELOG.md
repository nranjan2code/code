# Changelog

**Supported history begins at 2.0.0.** Every version before it is
unsupported and cannot be upgraded in place — see
`docs/design/46-stabilization-install-and-onboarding.md` Part VII.1. Entries
for those releases were removed from this file; `git log` holds them.

## Unreleased — 2.0.0

The runtime was finished before anyone outside the project could install it.
2.0.0 closes exactly that, and establishes the contract that keeps every
later release non-destructive.

### Baseline

- 2.0.0 is the supported baseline. State written by an earlier version is
  refused with an explicit message and the one command that resolves it; it
  is never partially read and never migrated.
- The update feed carries no version below 2.0.0.
- `AGENTS.md` invariant 29 forbids accepting, migrating, or special-casing
  pre-baseline state, and invariant 30 requires one canonical way per
  capability.

### Documentation

- Deleted eight design documents that described pre-baseline behavior or
  recorded provenance rather than contract: research notes, achievements,
  the vakyartha adoption study, the Tavily integration doc, the first-run
  onboarding and distribution proposals, the competitive landscape, and the
  unimplemented self-evolving-agent proposal.
- Added `docs/design/46-stabilization-install-and-onboarding.md`: bundling,
  release, install, first-run onboarding, the configuration and inheritance
  contract, and the forward-compatibility contract.
- Rewrote `docs/design/00-roadmap.md` against the baseline; it states what
  is true now and what is planned, not what was shipped.
- Repointed every code and doc citation of the deleted study at the document
  that actually owns each contract.
- `README.md` documents the canonical secret path correctly:
  `~/vak-home/.env`, not `data_home()/.env`.
